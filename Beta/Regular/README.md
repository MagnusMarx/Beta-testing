	Hello Fellow GitHub User!
	
	I see you find a slight bit of interest in the subject of: " The Offline Chrome Easter Egg." The contents of the project are of which correspond to the 
afformentioned subject in which you find interest in. This game was a simple school project that I then began to  "explore" other areas of the game that could be
modified. After the project was handed in, I only then realised that many other people may find joy in this marvelous game I have modified. I set out for a search
for a place to put the code so the public may view it and make copies to modify themselves. I had also wanted to host this game publicly so that the viewers of the
internet could view it. Sadly, azurewebsites cannot do that. Below lised is the link you may play the game.

																												Best,
																												Magnus Marks.
